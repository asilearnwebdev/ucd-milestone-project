Website can be found here:  https://asilearnwebdev.github.io/ucd-milestone-project-ideas/

## Website Description 
>The website is my dedication to the Jazz music style of the late l940’s called BOP.Many great recordings were made over the last 60 years and I want to shine a light on more of the many unknown musicians of the past and present.
I want to give the listener,musician,fan,record collector etc a one stop shop for video’s,recordings,books and to discover artists from all periods of the bop music genre.

## Who’s this website for? 
>This website is for newcomers and seasoned fans of the music genre.Jazz the art form has been around for 100 plus years.The trailblazers of the music have all passed on.The musical legacy they have left is still here to be discovered.I am hoping that visitors to the site will see an artist and go on to discover much more about them.

 ## THE JAZZ BOP LOWDOWN 
>The heyday of bop started in the late 40’s then moved into the hardbop style of the 50’s. Then throughout the 60’s the music came to be known as postbop/modern jazz.And in the late 60’s the great trumpeter Miles Davis stated.I quote “ Jazz is dead.Music of the museum”.The style became a fad to him and a lot of musicians stopped playing bop.
Musicians of the bop era went looking for new sounds,new avenues for expression during the late 60’s and all the way through to the early 80’s.In the late 80’s a resurgence began in the music.Bop or straight ahead musicians started to play and began recording with various labels.
This style is still being played today so as long they’re musicians out there who dedicate themselves to the art.Bop will never become the music of the museum.
Enjoy!!

## Website Function
>The function of the site is to have one-stop shop for the bop music genre.There’s many websites out there that cover all the styles from big band,bop,fusion,latin and smooth.Our website will dedicated itself to bop.

##  Additional Features To Be Deployed 
>As the website grows I will be adding additional features such as artist search,books,magazine publications,cd/lp/mp3 recommendations and audio to name a few.

## Testing and Troubleshooting
>Tested on Firefox,Opera,Chrome,Microsoft Edge,Safari and Brave web browsers.I found that depending whether i was viewing from a laptop,tablet or a desktop wide screen there where no changes in responsiveness.
Html and CSS page error checking.(W3 HTML and CSS Validator)
Google DEV tools used for carrying out real time changes/code testing.Manage to spot various errors in my coding.
Various faults on key players,contact and video html pages.This was down to incorrect syntax in all container area's.Page faults fixed and rectified by using W3 schools and html validators.
Tested website navigation on low end to high end spec pc's.intel,amd and pentium processors tested with ram starting at 1gb minimum and reaching 12gb maximum.


## Deployment 
>Created multiple wireframes  using the traditional method of pen and paper.Started with a grid comprising of containers creating spaces for photos,text and video.Added a background wallpaper to the html pages and used css to customise.
Our website will work with the essential tools to make it look and feel presentable and easy on the eye.
Navbar,footer,images and background colours have been carefully considered so they do not clash.
All typography is set to "Roboto" type font.
Social links are highlighted in the footer for easy navigation.
All images have their borders trimmed to give them a smooth effect.
As the website develops other features will be added later.For example the books/discography tab can serve as a feature library for biographies,music charts,and the artists timeline.

## User Stories

>I asked two of my work colleagues and a family member a couple questions.

>The 1st:-When you browse a website and the main page displays are you concerned with how it looks ie:-colours,content,fonts,images etc.Are these features important to you?.

>The 2nd:-You are on the site and looking for something specific.Are you concerned with how fast/responsive the website is or just happy that you could navigate easily and find what you were searching for?.

Answers:-They said.....

>Browsing to a site and finding what you need quickly is important.On the other hand browsing to a website and you find yourself searching and going around in circles to find what you need is a pain.They will go look elsewhere.

>Content was another issue but not for all.Sometimes too much content on a site can distract you from what you have came there to do in the first place.Any audio or video playing in the background is annoying unless you have selected media to play.

>Colours and images have to stand out and be pleasing to the eye.

These are generic questions that could apply to all sites.I agree with these answers and have addressed them in the website.As the website grows more questions pertaining to the project will be asked.





STRATEGY
>To create a website that's a one stop shop for newcomers and seasoned fans alike.
Features to be included are artist (search),timeline,video,galleries,discography,magazines,recording labels,radio and books.This website will go live as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) due to time restrictions.
SCOPE 
>As this site will go live as an MVP features will be implemented so that the user can get an overall experience with how to navigate through the site.We will concentrate on the four tab features below.

Artist
>This tab will become a search button for artists.The user will be able to search for a veteran of the music or find new artists.In the meantime we will concentrate on one artist and the band members.

Key Players
>This tab will focus on band members with a biography and images.

Video
>This tab will focus on archived or current videos of the artist.(Location source:- YOUTUBE)

Gallery
>This tab will focus on the artist's recordings.

STRUCTURE
>At this stage we will start to bring together the ideas found in the STARTEGY section.A navbar with tabs for home,artist,key players,video and a contact form.Each tab when clicked will go to a new html page.Html pages will have a full background image/wallpaper and footer icons for social media links.
Html grid will be setup with 3 to 4 containers which will use the entire width of the browser/screen.All container rows are coded for mobile first,tablet and desktop working.
Bootstrap framework and CSS tricks.com amongst other apps will be used to acheive our MVP.

SKELETON
>Wireframes found here:-https://github.com/asilearnwebdev/ucd-milestone-project-ideas/tree/master/wireframes

>Main index.html page has been created with tabs for home,band members(key players),featured artist,videos,music gallery and contact.The top priority for the user is to be able to click on any of the tabs to get the inforamation thats needed.For instance the "Key Players" tab will give the user a visual of the band members plus a biography.If the user wants to research further he/she can use the cloud icon in the footer.Our navbar is positioned  beneath the photo images.
